          <h2>Q1. Difference between local storage and session storage.</h2>
          <p>
            Local Storage : Local storage is the most recent mechanism. It
            allows for larger amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not
            deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is useful for
            storing data that the user will need to access later, such as
            offline data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Session Storage : Session storage is similar to cookies, but the
            data is only stored for the current session. This means that the
            data will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session
            storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login
            credentials.

            Q2. Difference between global scope and block scope in javascript.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Global Scope : The variables defined outside of any function or
            curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope.
            Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part
            of that program, any function or conditional state can access that
            variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Block Scope : Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The
            block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the
            curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
            conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to
            refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

          <h2>Q3.How to work javascript event loop?</h2>
          <p>
            The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and
            the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will
            take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
            Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick
            in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function callback.
